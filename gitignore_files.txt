Git Ignore is a method of telling Git not to transfer files to Github.

There are several ways that you can tell Git to ignore files, gitignore is not the only one.
With gitignore you can set the rules and parameters for the things you want Git to disregard and not
transfer to GitHub.

It is important to note that a gitignore file will not apply to any files that are already committed
to GitHub. The rules will only apply to untracked files, so it is important to establish a gitignore
from the beginning if you think you will need one.

There are many sources on GitHub and StackOverflow that show common gitignore patterns and configurations
so that you can get a good idea of how it works.
